1. Pricing Strategy
Your current design has two ways to modify prices:

TicketType.PriceModifier: Multiplies the base price

PriceTier.PercentageIncrease: Another multiplier

Consider:

Clarifying the order of operations (which modifier applies first)

Potentially consolidating pricing modifiers into a single concept

Adding audit logging for price changes

2. Inventory Management
You have:

Event.TotalSeats and AvailableSeats

But also seat assignments in Ticket

Recommendations:

Add validation to ensure assigned seats don't exceed capacity

Consider separating general admission (no assigned seats) from seated events

Add a reservation system to handle temporary holds on tickets during checkout

3. Discount Code Improvements
Current design is good but could be enhanced:

Add MinPurchaseAmount requirement for discounts

Consider adding user-specific discount codes

Add tracking of who used each discount code

4. Ticket Lifecycle
Your statuses (valid/used/etc.) are good. Consider adding:

Expiration dates for tickets

Transfer history if tickets change hands

Refund policy tracking

5. Additional Features to Consider
Ticket Transfers:

Your IsTransferable flag is a good start

Add transfer history and approval workflow

Waitlisting:

When events sell out, allow users to join a waitlist

Season Passes:

Tickets that grant access to multiple events

Access Control:

Integration with barcode scanners for entry validation
